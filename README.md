# David Akintayo — Portfolio

This repository contains a React + Vite portfolio for David Akintayo.

## Development

Requirements:
- Node.js 18.x (project declares this in `package.json`)

Install dependencies and run local dev server (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Build

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What I changed (quick summary)
- Improved accessibility and semantics in `Navbar` and `Hero`.
- Added a second hero CTA for the Resume and improved button labels.
- Hardened `Projects` rendering to handle missing images and optional live links.
- Cleaned and tuned `App.css` to reduce excessive padding and improve button/brand styles.
- Updated social meta tags in `index.html` to use a local preview image as a placeholder.
- Added this README with quick start instructions.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add Tailwind CSS or a design system for faster iteration.
- Improve typography and add additional responsive tweaks.
- Add an automated contact form integration (Netlify, Formspree, or serverless).

Tell me which of those you'd like next and I will implement it.
